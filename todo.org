* Refactoring
** Move as much of the data handling into SfgRecord as pssible
*** Make more use of SfgRecord internal members in the widgets
     Move the handling of the baselinesubstraction from widgets into SfgRecords.
*** SfgRecord Reset internal data method
** Refactor Widgets with a 3rd class encapsulating the data handling
** Make generic Selectors based on gui for arbitrary 4d-Data
    This will seperate gui and data handling for the plot further.
    The goal is to have a method, that is reusable throughout
    raw data, baseline subtracted, bleach and if possible even summed.
** Refactor _init_widgets to be more readable
** Use plotgrid for figure init in widgets
** Init for WidgetFigures
** Rename WidgetFigures to MatplotlibFigures
    When the seperation is done, I can exchange the plotting backend
** Remove the _ functions form Widgets. They are too many
** Combine the get_trace methods in SfgRecord
** Introduce SfgRecord._rawData and SfgRecord._data
** Apply medfilt globally in SfgRecord
** Add more shapechecker in SfgRecod.base setter
** DONE Rename the .x and .y data methods to something usefull
