    "# Plotting\n",
    "To plot data we use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) its not always the most conviniet plotting. However it is free widely used and really really powerfull. There is almost nothing it can't do. There is no reason to explain matplotlib here, a good starting point is the default [tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py). The only thing you need to note right now, is that we made all of the matplotlib functionas availe in the first line of code `%pylab notebook`. This imports all the matplotlib functions in the way you need them.\n",

This has quite some functions in it, but many are deprecated, or for a very special usecase. You dont need to master all of them. For now `sfg2d.plot.spectrum`, `sfg2d.plot.trace` and `sfg2d.plot.track` should be enough."
